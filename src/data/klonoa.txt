Klonoa (クロノア, Kuronoa), sometimes referred to as Klonoa of the Wind (風のクロノア, Kaze no Kuronoa) is an anthropomorphic humanoid long-eared cat like creature who is the main protagonist in the Klonoa franchise. He was created by Namco and Klonoa Works, and has starred in his own series since 1997.

Klonoa is known for being a determined, friendly and good-natured individual, often helping others and saving the various worlds he finds himself in from all sorts of trouble.

His kindness was reflected in Lunatea's Veil, when a strange voice was calling him, known as a "Dream Voice", and was later found out to be the King of Sorrow, for he was sad because people had forgotten him. When Klonoa acknowledged who the voice was, with an open heart, he helped the King of Sorrow by ringing the Fifth Bell of the Kingdom of Sorrow and made sure that Lunatea would never forget sorrow.
