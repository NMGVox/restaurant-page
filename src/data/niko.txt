Niko is the playable protagonist of OneShot. They are a child with blue hair with three "whiskers" jutting out from the sides, yellow catlike eyes, and tan skin. They wear a brown overcoat extending over their arms, a long light blue scarf, a brown hat with catlike ears, and grayish-purple bottoms that appear to be leggings. They are tasked with returning the Sun to the Tower and saving the World from dying out.

    Niko is a very kind and caring kid. Being the messiah that the prophecy had foretold, they became determined to reach the Tower and bring the sun back to it in order to save the World, even despite various other people stating that the sun won't stop the World from dying. Niko is also helpful, which is shown when they repair the Rowbot at the dock in the Barrens, and volunteer to find Alula and return her to Calamus in the Glen.
